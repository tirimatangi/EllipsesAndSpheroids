function [intersectionPoints, relativeModelError] = solveEllipseIntersections(sharedFocalPoint, otherFocalPoints, diameters)
%solveIntersections Calculates intersections of ellipses and spheroids with a shared focal point.
%   Calculates intersections of ellipses (2D) or spheroids (3D). All ellipses are assumed to have the first focal point  
%   at the same position and the second focal point at the given coordinates.
%   The algorithm for 3D spheroids is described below. The 2D case is similar but simpler.
%
%   The diameters along the major semiaxes determine the sum of distances from the first focal point to 
%   any point on the locus of the ellipse or spheroid and further on to the second focal point.
%   Without loss of generality we assume that the first focal point of each spheroid is at the origin 
%   and fp = otherFocalPoints - sharedFocalPoint is the set of the second focal points.
%   Now assume that [x y z] is an intersection of the spheroids. Its distance from the origin is denoted by w.
%   Now the intersection point must satisfy the following N+1 conditions where N is the number of intersecting spheroids:
%
%                                           x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = w^2
%       (x - fp(1,1))^2 + (y - fp(2,1))^2 + (z - fp(3,1))^2 = (diam(1) - w)^2
%       ...
%       (x - fp(1,N))^2 + (y - fp(2,N))^2 + (z - fp(3,N))^2 = (diam(N) - w)^2
%
% By expanding the squares in N last equations and subtracting the first equation
% from the expanded squares, we get an N-by-4 linear system  T*[x y z w]' = r as follows:
%
%   [-2 fp(1,1) -2 fp(2,1) -2 fp(3,1) diam(1)] [x] = [diam(1)^2 - fp(1,1)^2 - fp(2,1)^2 - fp(3,1)^2]
%   [                   ...                  ] [y] = [      ....                       ]
%   [                   ...                  ] [z] = [      ....                       ]
%   [-2 fp(1,N) -2 fp(2,N) -2 fp(3,N) diam(N)] [w] = [diam(N)^2 - fp(1,N)^2 - fp(2,N)^2 - fp(3,N)^2]
%
%   So T = -2 * [fp(1,:)' fp(2,:)' fp(3,:)' diam] and r =  diam.^2 - fp(1,:)'.^2 - fp(2,:)'.^2 - fp(3,:)'.^2;
%
%   Notice that a row of T may be linearly dependent on the other rows. Those cases can be dealt with
%   by writing the dependent row as a linear combination of the other rows and using the fact that
%   x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = w^2 to solve the coefficients of the linear combination. This will be explained in
%   comments in the code below.
%
%   Inputs:
%       sharedFocalPoint - The focal point which is shared by all ellipses / spheroids, DIM-by-1 vector
%       otherFocalPoints - The other (non-shared) focal points as DIM-by-N matrix.
%          In 2D case, N should be 2 or 3. In 3D case, N should be 3 or 4.
%       diameters - Diameters of the ellipses along the major semiaxes as an N-by-1 vector.
%   Output:
%       intersectionPoints - Coordinates of the points where all N ellipses intersect. 
%                            A 2-by-M or 3-by-M matrix where M is 1 of the intersection point is unique and 2 if there are two candidates.
%                            If the matrix is empty, there is no common intersection point.
%                            Note that if there is noise or other inaccuracy in the set of diameters, the all ellipses/spheroids
%                            may not actually intersect at the given points. In this case distanceError will be large
%                            so the inaccuracy can be detected.
%       relativeModelError - Relative difference between the actual squared distance of the calculated intersection point(s)
%                            from the shared focal point (i.e. x^2+y^2+z^2) and the squared distance predicted by
%                            the model (i.e. w^2). So relativeModelError = sqrt(abs(x^2+y^2+z^2 - w^2) / x^2+y^2+z^2).
%                            The larger the value, the less reliable the result is. 
%                            The value is very near zero if all ellipses/spheroids intersect at the same points.
